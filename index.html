          Create a better document/image reader for low vision individuals.
          Users can drop digital documents or images into the web app, which
          will vocalize both the text and visual aspects/layout of the document.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to develop a web application that converts
          PDFs, handwritten text, and images into speech for Blind-Low Vision
          (BLV) users.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Background Information -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>
          The problem is critical because it aims to help the BLV community keep
          up with fast-changing technology, which has been heavily incorporated
          into education and advancements. Since enhancing visual consumption of
          information can be complicated and expensive, our project provides
          sound-based consumption as a complementary alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another issue is that much of the existing technology (such as AR
          glasses) is extremely costly. Our goal is to develop more affordable
          or open-source alternatives.

        <h3>General Questions</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Should we even be doing this?</strong><br />
          Yes, improving accessibility for BLV users is a meaningful application
          of AI, but we must be mindful of ethical concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >What might be the accuracy of a simple non-ML alternative?</strong
          ><br />
          A rule-based OCR system (software that turns printed or typed text
          from images into digital text using fixed rules) could achieve some
          success but would likely struggle with handwritten text and complex
          layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What processes will we use to handle appeals/mistakes?</strong
          ><br />
          We will set up a process to review errors and adjust the training data
          or model parameters to improve accuracy over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How diverse is our team?</strong><br />
          It’s pretty diverse!
        </p>

        <h3>Data Questions</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Is our data valid for its intended use?</strong><br />
          We need to verify that our training data includes diverse handwriting
          styles, fonts, and document structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What bias could be in our data?</strong><br />
          Potential biases include overrepresentation of certain text styles or
          languages, which could lead to disparities in accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How could we minimize bias in our data and model?</strong
          ><br />
          We should collect diverse datasets and test performance across
          different user demographics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How should we “audit” our code and data?</strong><br />
          Regular audits should check for performance discrepancies across
          different groups and validate fairness in model outputs.
        </p>

        <h3>Impact Questions</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Do we expect different error rates for different sub-groups in the
            data?</strong
          ><br />
          Yes, varying text styles and writing systems may lead to disparities
          that require targeted improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What are likely misinterpretations of the results?</strong
          ><br />
          Users may over-rely on automated outputs, so we should provide
          disclaimers and encourage manual review where necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >How might we impinge individuals’ privacy and/or anonymity?</strong
          ><br />
          Ensuring that our tool does not store sensitive user data and follows
          strict privacy policies is crucial.
